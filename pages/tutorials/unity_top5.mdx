The Unity engine is a great tool for any aspiring indie developer to start making games today. Unity provides the option for both 2D and 3D games. One of the biggest benefits using Unity over Roblox is that you have full control over your game and are able to get all of the revenue from it!

Some of the biggest games are made in the Unity engine including, but not limited to, Rust, Fall Guys and Genshin Impact.

I have been making games as a side hobby for a while now and I suggest anyone looking to make gamers in their free time to use Unity!
